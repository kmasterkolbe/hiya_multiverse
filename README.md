Hello world (test repo)


Here I've now made some edits.  

Today I smoked a batch of salmon for the first time in months.  I'd never used hickory wood before.  Literally every source of information on smoking salmon will tell you to use alder wood.  Alder has a mild but noticeable aroma, a bit stronger than apple wood.  Hickory is sometimes even too strong for pork, let alone fish - so I'm excited to see how it comes out.  

I see two possibilities: it's tremendously good, or it's far too strong.  The fish sat in the smoke for maybe five hours, so it shouldn't be overpowering (on a cold winter day it can go as long as 18 hours absorbing smoke without drying out - those pieces get an incredibly rich smoky flavor).  I'm excited to try it!
